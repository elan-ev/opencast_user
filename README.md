Ansible: Opencast User Role
===========================

This Ansible role creates an Opencast user Linux with a specific user and group
id to ensure they are identical on the whole cluster.


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
    - role: lkiesow.opencast_user
```
